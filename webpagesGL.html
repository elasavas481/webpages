        <!-- This is the best way to get from University Towers to Talley Student Union-->
         <p>I left <em>University</em> Towers and made my way down to <strong>Talley</strong> Student Union, the morning air still cool. The path was quiet, with only a few students out and about as the campus slowly came to life. The buildings around me were familiar, their outlines sharp against the sky, but the walk always felt like a brief pause before the day kicked into gear. By the time I reached Talley, the buzz of campus energy had started to fill the air.</p>
